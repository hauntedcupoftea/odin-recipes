    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The Paneer Cheela is one of my favorites. It was introduced to me by my cousin when I first started
        going to the gym and trying to lose weight. It's essentially a form of Roti or Tortilla, except it's
        made with chickpea batter (known as 'Besan' or Gram Flour). This marvelous flour is perfect for 
        Vegetarians looking to start gyming, as it contains not a lot carbohydrates while giving you an immense
        22g of protein per 100 grams.
    </p>
    <p>
        Paneer is the real star of the show, however. Every vegetarian at some point has had a phase where 
        they've been obsessed with paneer. While having a higher fat content than Besan, paneer is still great.
        Tofu remains a healthier alternative for those with dietary restrictions or a fear of milk, and this 
        recipe can be modified to subtitute tofu for paneeer to experience that too.

    <p>
        It's a relatively simple dish that takes around 20-25 minutes to prepare. Recipe courtesy of My Mom ðŸ˜Š.
